                About
                ~~~~~
This is a mod that makes a bonus merchant in IWD2 selling equipment from
BG2. If you've played BG2, you know how these bonus merchants work: vastly
overpriced, moderately powerful items that you wouldn't get anywhere else. 

                Installation
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~
IWD2 is required. It should work fine with any WeiDU mod. See the webpage
for details. 

Extract the main EXE file into your IWD2 main directory. This is normally:
        C:\Program Files\Black Isle\Icewind Dale II\

Run (click on) "Setup-Merchant.exe". 

Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always
uninstall them later by re-running "Setup-Merchant.exe". 

You do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you
installed. But some of them only help at the beginning. 

The components should install correctly for international players who have
both DIALOG.TLK and DIALOGF.TLK. 

                BG2 Bonus Merchant
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This adds Ribald Barterman as a bonus merchant selling BG2 equipment. He
appears in the Gallaway Trading Post and Conlan's Smithy in Kuldahar. All
of the items have been faithfully converted to Third Edition / Icewind Dale
2 rules and statistics. For example, Katanas are now (Masterwork) Bastard
Swords, etc.  We also continue the tradition of offering items that you
shouldn't really be able to use (like the Zerth Blade in BG2). 

Special Note: "adamantine" does not dissolve in IWD2. For example, 
Stormcaller, Hammer of Lightning, Order's Nemesis, Life's Blood Drinker,
Implaer, Rage of Chaos, Despana Insignia, and Despana Piwafwi are all made
from it in vanilla IWD2 and none of them turn to dust. 

Items:
        Equalizer
        Flail of Ages
        Gesen Short Bow
        Jaheira's Harper Pin
        Blackblood
        Jansen Adventurewear
        Flasher Master Bruiser Mate
        Hallowed Redeemer
        Firecam Full-Plate
        Mace of Disruption
        Shadow Dragon Armor
        Drow Elven Chain
        Tsuki no Ken
        Corthala Family Blade
        Corthala Family Armor
        Sword of Arvoreen
